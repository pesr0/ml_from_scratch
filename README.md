# Machine Learning Models From Scratch

This repository is intended for keeping and explain briefly some of the most commom ML models (Linear ad Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, etc.)
<br>
Every model will be implemented in a simple way, where the main focus is the mathematical logic behind the model.
<br>
Since the implementation is focused in the mathematical logic, the implementations will not be to much refined.
<br><br>
For now, the available implementations are:
