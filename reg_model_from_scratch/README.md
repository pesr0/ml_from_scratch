# Linear Regression Model Implementation

In order to better undertand this mode implementation, it is important to understand the line equation first.
<br>

The line equation is defined by: <b>y = wx + b</b>, where y is a y coord, x is the x coord relative to that y, w is the weight of the funcion and b is the bias.
The weight of that function represents the slope of the line defined by the function, and the bias represents how much the height on the line varies in the Y axis where x = 0.
Hence,  with these 2 paremters, it is posible to determine a line function.
